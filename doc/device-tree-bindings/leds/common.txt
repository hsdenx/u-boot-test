Common leds properties.

Optional properties for child nodes:
- label : The label for this LED.  If omitted, the label is
  taken from the node name (excluding the unit address).

- function:
  LED function. Use one of the LED_FUNCTION_* prefixed definitions
  from the header include/dt-bindings/leds/common.h. If there is no
  matching LED_FUNCTION available, add a new one.

- color:
  Color of the LED. Use one of the LED_COLOR_ID_* prefixed definitions from
  the header include/dt-bindings/leds/common.h. If there is no matching
  LED_COLOR_ID available, add a new one.

- function-enumerator:
  optional
    Integer to be used when more than one instance of the same function is
    needed, differing only with an ordinal number.

- linux,default-trigger :  This parameter, if present, is a
    string defining the trigger assigned to the LED.  Current triggers are:
     "backlight" - LED will act as a back-light, controlled by the framebuffer
		   system
     "default-on" - LED will turn on (but for leds-gpio see "default-state"
		    property in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/led.txt)
     "heartbeat" - LED "double" flashes at a load average based rate
     "ide-disk" - LED indicates disk activity
     "timer" - LED flashes at a fixed, configurable rate

Examples:

system-status {
	label = "Status";
	linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
	...
};

led-0 {
	function = LED_FUNCTION_STATUS;
	color = <LED_COLOR_ID_RED>;
	function-enumerator = <20>;
	...
};

led-1 {
	function = LED_FUNCTION_STATUS;
	color = <LED_COLOR_ID_YELLOW>;
	...
};
